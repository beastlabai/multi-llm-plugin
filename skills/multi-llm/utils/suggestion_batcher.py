"""
Suggestion batcher module for grouping suggestions into efficient subagent batches.

This module takes validated suggestions and groups them intelligently for processing
by fewer subagents, reducing API calls while maintaining edit safety.

Grouping Heuristics:
1. Reference/Section Proximity - Group suggestions targeting the same section
2. Type Compatibility - Don't mix deletions with other types
3. Batch Size Limits - Prevent context rot with max suggestions per batch
4. Dependency Ordering - Process deletions first, then modifications, then additions
