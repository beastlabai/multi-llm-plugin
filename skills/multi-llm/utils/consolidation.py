    Loads the template from ``templates/consolidated_report_template.html``,
    injects a JSON data payload via the ``REPORT_DATA_PLACEHOLDER`` pattern
    (replacing ``/* REPORT_DATA_PLACEHOLDER */null`` with the actual data),
    and writes the result.

    Args:
        consolidated_groups: List of consolidated group dicts.
        groups: The original groups list from ``grouped.json`` (for
            building the ``underlyingGroups`` array in the data payload).
        phase_dir: Path to the review-plan phase directory.
        plan_path: Path to the original plan file (used for title
            extraction and ``planPath`` in the data).
        models: List of model identifier strings that contributed
            suggestions.
        validation: Optional validation results list (from validation.json).
            When provided, validation status badges are shown for each
            underlying group and an aggregate status is computed for each
            consolidated group.

    Returns:

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the consolidated report template is missing.
        ValueError: If the template does not contain the data placeholder.
